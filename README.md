## `Project Description`
This Project has two Main pages  <br/>
1)  To search and add Books to Shelf <br/>
    Route : ./ <br/>
2)  To Display all added Books in  Cards <br/>
    Route : ./mybooks<br/>


## ` How It Works`

Enter your search query in the input field and click the search button.</br>
The application sends a request to an API with your search query.</br>
The API fetches the relevant book data and returns it to the frontend.</br>
The frontend displays the book cards with detailed information.</br>
You can add books of your choice to your personal bookshelf by clicking the "Add" button.</br>
All added books are stored in local storage for easy access on the second page, the bookshelf.</br>
